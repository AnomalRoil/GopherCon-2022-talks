# Kraken Wrangling for Dummies

Hello, Gophers

These are the slides from my talk at GopherCon 2022, _Kraken Wrangling for Dummies: Go Modules Dependency Management at Scale_.

The slides are [here](slides.pdf) and the [project source](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/perseus) is on GitHub under CrowdStrike's organization.  Reach out to me on GitHub if you have questions or comments or would like to use Perseus or contribute.

And best of luck defeating your own krakens!
